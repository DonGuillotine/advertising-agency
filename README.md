# Advertising Agency System
<h2>An Advertising Agency System built with Java JFrame with MySQL database</h2>

<h3>I built a comprehensive platform that allows for the management of advertisements by an administrator and employees, with different levels of access and functionality, utilizing a MySQL database.</h3>

<h3>The log in and register functionality allows users to securely create and access their accounts, with a forget password functionality for recovering lost credentials, providing access to the system's features and functionality based on their role and permissions.</h3>
